Here is a list of all commands necessary to run each simulation from our different input files.
The program is written in python so as long as python is installed and the make package, you will be able to run all commands below.
In the results folder you can find the results of various methods in detailed and verbose modes. 
The main.py file contains all necessary code in order to run the algorithms with the use of 3 different input files (Feasible, not_feasible, and preemption).
If you would like to run your own command line instead of using the make commands below you will simply need python and run this command:
    python3 main.py (-d or -v) -a (RM or DM or EDF) < (feasible.txt or not_feasible.txt or preemption.txt)
a detailed feasible RM command completed would look like: python3 main.py -d -a RM < feasible.txt
the file_generation.py file can be used to create a new input_file.txt and will create the file with a random number of processes between 5 and 10.

# For Feasible.txt Input:
make run_ALL
make run_ALLDetailed
make run_RMDetailed
make run_DMDetailed
make run_EDFDetailed

# For Not Feasible.txt Input:
make run_NOT_FEASIBLE_ALL
make run_NOT_FEASIBLE_ALLDetailed
make run_NOT_FEASIBLE_RMDetailed
make run_NOT_FEASIBLE_DMDetailed
make run_NOT_FEASIBLE_EDFDetailed
make run_NOT_FEASIBLE_RMVerbose
make run_NOT_FEASIBLE_DMVerbose
make run_NOT_FEASIBLE_EDFVerbose

# For Preemption.txt Input:
make run_PREEMPTION_ALL
make run_PREEMPTION_RMVerbose
make run_PREEMPTION_DMVerbose
make run_PREEMPTION_EDFVerbose
